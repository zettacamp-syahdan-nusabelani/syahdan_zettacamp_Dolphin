        Kamikaze (stylized as KAMIKAZÆŽ) is the tenth studio album by American rapper Eminem, released on August 31, 2018, through Shady
        Records, Aftermath Entertainment, and Interscope Records. The album was released with no prior announcement. It features guest
        appearances from Joyner Lucas, Royce da 5'9", Jessie Reyez, and uncredited vocals by Justin Vernon from the band Bon Iver. Eminem,
        credited as Slim Shady, and Dr. Dre served as executive producers, while production was handled by Eminem himself alongside a
        variety of producers such as Boi-1da, Tay Keith, Ronny J, Mike Will Made It, frequent collaborator Luis Resto, and others. Following
        the polarizing reception of his previous album, Revival (2017), music journalists debated over whether the rapper's relevance and
        ability were waning. In response to the criticism, Eminem released a remix of the song "Chloraseptic" in January 2018 featuring 2
        Chainz and Phresher. Kamikaze represents a continuation of this response, containing various insults against critics and rappers
        alike. The artwork is an homage to Beastie Boys' debut album, Licensed to Ill (1986). Kamikaze received mixed reviews from critics.
        Some praised it as an improvement over the rapper's previous album and a welcome return to his more aggressive style, while others
        criticized Eminem for focusing too much on the reception of Revival throughout the album, and for his lack of adaption to the
        current sound of hip hop. The album also generated some controversy for its diss tracks against various artists. The album was
        promoted with three singles: "Fall", "Venom", from the 2018 movie of the same name, and "Lucky You", and a music video for "Good
        Guy", along with a supporting tour. Commercially, the album reached number one in 18 countries, becoming Eminem's ninth consecutive
        number-one album in the United States, and later becoming the best-selling hip-hop album of 2018. It later received platinum
        certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
