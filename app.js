  // For Loop Iteration
  // function contains a for loop that iterates through the number of books to be purchased (amountToPurchase). This loop handles the process of purchasing each book and displays relevant information for each iteration.

  // Check if the book is out of stock

  // Break When Book is Out of Stock:
  // there is a check that looks at the remainingBookStock variable. If the stock of the book reaches zero, meaning the book is out of stock, the loop will break using the break statement. This ensures that the loop stops when the book is no longer available.

  // Display Text Based on Stock Availability:
  // There are conditional checks that provide different messages based on the stock availability and the current iteration. If the stock of the book is exhausted (remainingBookStock === 0), it displays a message that the book is out of stock. If the iteration is less than the amountToPurchase - 1, it displays a message that the user can purchase another book. Otherwise, it displays a message that the user has purchased all the books they wanted.
